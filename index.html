      <strong>My love,</strong><br>
      Ading Maria<br><br>
      Today marks nine beautiful years since our journey began —<br>
      nine years of love, laughter, growth, challenges, and moments that shaped us.<br>
      And even after all this time… I still look at you and fall in love all over again.<br><br>
      In nine years, we’ve created memories that live deep in my bones —<br>
      the way your hand fits mine so naturally,<br>
      the way your voice calms the noise in my world,<br>
      the way your love makes me feel safe, seen, and deeply cherished.<br><br>
      But what amazes me most is that…<br>
      my love for you hasn’t stayed the same — it’s grown.<br>
      It has deepened with time,<br>
      softened with forgiveness,<br>
      and solidified through every ordinary moment we've chosen to stay.<br><br>
      Because the truth is…<br>
      we don’t always love each other the same every day.<br>
      Some days, love feels loud and easy.<br>
      Some days, love is quiet — hard, even.<br>
      There are days when we argue,<br>
      days when pride speaks louder than our hearts.<br>
      But no matter how heavy the day gets,<br>
      we always choose each other.<br>
      And somehow, after every fight,<br>
      we love each other even deeper.<br><br>
      You are my greatest comfort.<br>
      My calm in chaos.<br>
      My warmest home.<br>
      My favorite voice in a noisy world.<br>
      My one true love.<br><br>
      And after nine years, here’s what I know more than ever:<br>
      I choose you. Still. Always. Again and again.<br>
      I’ll keep choosing you — on the soft days,<br>
      on the stormy days,<br>
      on the in-between days.<br>
      And in every lifetime our souls are given the chance,<br>
      I’ll find you… and I’ll choose you.<br><br>
      Nine years behind us…<br>
      and yet it feels like we’re only just beginning.<br>
      There are still so many memories we’ve yet to create,<br>
      so many mornings I want to wake up beside you,<br>
      so many dreams I want to share with only you.<br><br>
      Thank you for loving me when I least deserved it.<br>
      Thank you for staying when it would’ve been easier to walk away.<br>
      Thank you for being my peace, my fire, and my forever.<br><br>
      <em>Happy 9th Anniversary, my love.</em><br>
      Here’s to everything we’ve been,<br>
      everything we are,<br>
      and everything we’ll still become — together.<br><br>
      <strong>Ikaw ang pahinga…<br>
      at sa araw-araw na pag gising ko,<br>
      ikaw at ikaw pa rin ang pipiliin ko.</strong><br><br>
      Forever yours,<br>
      Ading Jap
